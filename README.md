Evo C++ Library
---------------

Evo is a modern high-performance C++ library designed to make handling data structures and 
strings easy.

Inspired by modern languages like Python and D, Evo is the result of many years of lessons
learned from writing (and rewriting) high-performance, object-oriented C++ server code.
Even when performance isn't critical, Evo can still make tedious string parsing and data
structures easy to read and manage. Evo is intended to provide a solid foundation for
applications and other libraries.
