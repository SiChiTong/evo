Evo is a modern high performance C++ library designed to make writing efficient and portable code easy.

Inspired by modern languages like Python and D, Evo is the result of many years of lessons learned from writing (and rewriting) high-performance, object oriented C++ server code. Evo aims to make C++ easier and more powerful without sacrificing performance.
